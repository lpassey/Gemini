Google Gemini has the potential to be a worthwhile coding assistant, but the infrastructure is appalling. This project has three goals:

1. To collect best practices and hints to work with the Google Gemini web application (easier said than done).
2. To create a Java client application which makes use of the Gemini public api designed to replace the Gemini web application
3. To create a repository of random files designed solely to be referenced by Google Gemini
